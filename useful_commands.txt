All the flask commands rely on the FLASK_APP environment variable to know where the Flask application lives
db - this is the name of database, which we've declared before (it can be different in other projects)

TERMINAL

flask run           -> sub-command that is native to Flask (running web)
flask db            -> sub-command which is added by Flask-Migrate to manage everything related to database migrations
flask db init       -> creating migration repository for RepEAT (or other web app)
flask db migrate    -> sub-command generates automatic migrations (f.e flask db migrate -m 'users table')
                        it doesn't make any changes to the database, but it just only generates migration script
flask db upgrade    -> sub-command which applies the migration
                        to apply the changes to the database, this command must be used
flask db downgrade  -> sub-command which removes migration, this also undoeas the last migration


=============================

CODE

db.session                      -> context of a session
db.session.add(any_variable)    -> add new elements to the session
db.session.commit()             -> register all changes which are accumulated in session
                                    it writes all changes automatically
db.session.rollback             -> abort the session and remove any changes stored in it
db.session.delete(any_variable) -> erase created data, so the database is cleaning (remove post, visit etc...)
